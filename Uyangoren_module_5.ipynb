    "1. Perform a single step of the Crank-Nicolson method for this electron, calculating the vector $\\psi(t)$ of values of the wavefunction, given the initial wavefunction above and using $N = 1000$ spatial slices with $a = L/N$. Your program will have to perform the following steps. First, given the vector $\\psi(0)$ at $t = 0$, you will have to multiply by the matrix $\\bf{B}$ to get a vector $\\bf{v} = \\bf{B}\\psi$. Because of the tridiagonal form of $\\bf{B}$, this is fairly simple. The $i$th component of $\\bf{v}$ is given by\n",
    "$$ v_i = b_1\\psi_i + b_2(\\psi_{i+1} + \\psi_{i-1}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "   You will also have to choose a value for the time-step $h$. A reasonable choice is $h = 10^{-18}$ s. *(30 pts.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Second you will have to solve the linear system ${\\bf Ax}= {\\bf v}$ for $\\bf{x}$, which gives you the new value of $\\psi$. You could do this using a standard linear equation solver like the function $\\tt solve$ in numpy's $\\tt linalg$. *(20 pts.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Once you have the code in place to perform a single step of the calculation, extend your program to perform repeated steps and hence solve for $\\psi$ at a sequence of times a separation $h$ apart. Note that the matrix $\\bf A$ is independent of time, so it doesn't change from one step to another. You can set up the matrix just once and then keep on reusing it for every step. *(30 pts.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Make an animation of the solution by displaying the real part of the wavefunction at each time-step. You can use the function rate from the package visual to ensure a smooth frame-rate for your animation-- see Section 3.5 on page 117 of the Newman text.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Run your animation for a while and describe what you see. Write a few sentences explaining in physics terms what is going on in the system. *(20 pts.)*"
